//declaring varibles
var a = 67 
// a contains 67

console.log(a) // shows that a hold's the value of 67;

a = "harry"
console.log(a) // here we can re-assign with var value changed from 67 to harry

 let 8harry = 7 // Not allowed this will throw  you an error naming a variable name starting a number cannot allowed in javascript
 
 let var = 7 // a name mustnot contain a number as starting and a any symbols other than dollar are not conventional naming practises
 
 // let and const are the newest way of declaring the variables in js; let can be changeable and const cannot be changble
